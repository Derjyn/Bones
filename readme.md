# Bones
Bones is a minimal-frills grid system utilizing flexbox. There are a few extras
included, such as a very basic reset, some utility classes that expand upon the
functionality of the grid system, various media queries for common device screen
sizes, and some basic typography and print styling.

Eventually, the more visual bits of the system will be moved into it's own project,
"Flesh". Bones is very much in an alpha state, but is already usable for getting
a layout off the ground and responsive.


### Roadmap
* Tighten up media queries
