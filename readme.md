# Bones
Bones is a minimal-frills grid system utilizing flexbox. There are a few extras
included such as a very basic reset, some mod and utility classes that expand upon the
functionality of the grid system, and various media queries for common device screen
sizes.

The overview and usage (as well as demos) can be found [here](http://derjyn.github.io/Bones).
Eventually this readme will be updated to contain more details on usage as well.
