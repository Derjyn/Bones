                <h2>Bones Overview and Usage</h2>
                <p>
                    Bones is a simple grid layout framework for developing responsive sites utilizing flexbox.
                    Apart from the core layout classes, there are several other utility classes that aid
                    in designing clean and snappy websites. It can be frustrating to re-invent the wheel
                    constantly, and having a base to start with helps increase the speed of developing a
                    site's layout and design. Many other frameworks exist but most are very bloated and
                    difficult to customize or rip apart for one's own devious needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where Bones comes in. Currently in the alpha stages, Bones already shines at
                    providing a solid base to get common layouts functioning. You can view an example
                    of a common layout built using Bones <a href="layout.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    In the future, Bones will be married with <i>Flesh</i>, to become a complete site-kit.
                    If Bones were the layout side of the coin, Flesh would be the visual side. Components
                    within the core Bones CSS will be pulled out and moved over to Flesh, such as the print
                    styles and typography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "skinny" bit of Bones, is in it's simplicity and size. With comments and before
                    any sort of compression, the layout components (the core of Bones) takes us up under
                    150 lines of code. As previously mentioned, other components of the CSS in Bones will
                    be pulled out and implemented into Flesh. Finally, you can check out a visual demo
                    of the grid system <a href="demo.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Onto the usage details!

                <h3>Spines and Ribs</h3>
                <p>
                    When we reference a grid system, we generally think of elements being laid out in rows
                    and columns. In Bones, a <code>spine</code> would be the row, and a <code>rib</code>
                    would be a column within that row. A spine will fill it's parent container in width.
                    Bones is based on eighths; that is, a full width rib is 100%, on down to the smallest
                    rib being one-eighth the size of it's parent spine. Below is a reference of the rib sizes 
                    with class names.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>rib one</code> : 12.5%</li>
                    <li><code>rib two</code> : 25%</li>
                    <li><code>rib three</code> : 37.5%</li>
                    <li><code>rib four</code> : 50%</li>
                    <li><code>rib five</code> : 62.5%</li>
                    <li><code>rib six</code> : 75%</li>
                    <li><code>rib seven</code> : 87.5%</li>
                    <li><code>rib full</code> : 100%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    So for example, you could create a single row, three column layout area like this:
                    <pre>
                        &ltdiv class="spine"&gt
                            &ltdiv class="rib two"&gtCONTENT&lt/div&gt
                            &ltdiv class="rib four"&gtCONTENT&lt/div&gt
                            &ltdiv class="rib two"&gtCONTENT&lt/div&gt
                        &lt/div&gt
                    </pre>

                    Your rib sizes don't necessarily have to add up to eight either. Many grid systems
                    require your columns to add up to their max sizing scheme, such as a twelve column
                    based system need to be something like 4+6+2=12. These systems sometimes break, or
                    at the least corral you into using their sizing standard. Bones is simple to change.
                    If you wanted, you could easily modify it to be based on 10, 12, or 16 column based
                    sizing. To assist in making ribs easy to work with, there mod classes, which are
                    covered below.

                <h3>Mods</h3>
                <p>
                    Several "mod" classes exist in Bones, to help more finely tweak layouts. Mods
                    differ from utilities, in that mods specifically affect ribs. Below is an
                    overview of these mod classes.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>l-margin</code> : Adds a 16px margin to the left of a rib</li>
                    <li><code>r-margin</code> : Adds a 16px margin to the right of a rib</li>
                    <li><code>t-margin</code> : Adds a 16px margin above a rib</li>
                    <li><code>b-margin</code> : Adds a 16px margin below a rib</li>
                    <li><code>push-one</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 12.5% margin</li>
                    <li><code>push-two</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 25% margin</li>
                    <li><code>push-three</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 37.5% margin</li>
                    <li><code>push-four</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 50% margin</li>
                    <li><code>push-five</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 62.5% margin</li>
                    <li><code>push-six</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 75% margin</li>
                    <li><code>push-seven</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 87.5% margin</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    On top of mods, there are various utility classes that assist even more in fine
                    tuning a layout. Over time, new utility classes may be added to Bones, but for
                    now you can take find an overview of the current ones below.
                </p>

                    <li><code>body ine-sixty</code> - Sets max width of the body to 960px</li>
                    <li><code>body twelve-eighty</code> - Sets the body to a maximum width of 1280px</li>
                    <li><code>breaker</code> - A hard break, 100% width</li>
