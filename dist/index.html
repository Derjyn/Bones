        <h2>Bones Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p>
          Bones is a simple grid layout system for developing responsive sites
          utilizing flexbox. Apart from the core layout classes, there are
          several mod and utility classes that aid in designing clean and
          snappy websites. It can be frustrating to re-invent the wheel
          constantly, and having a base to start with helps increase the speed
          of developing a site's layout and design. Many other frameworks exist,
          but are bloated and difficult to customize or rip apart for one's own
          devious needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where Bones comes in. Currently in the beta stages, Bones
          already shines at providing a solid base to get responsive layouts
          running. In the future, Bones will be married with <i>Flesh</i>, to
          become a complete front-end site kit, known as <i>Soma</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "skinny" bit of Bones, is in it's simplicity and size. With
          comments and before any sort of compression, the layout components
          (the core of Bones) take up under 150 lines of code. Now, onto some
          usage details!

        <h3>Spines and Ribs</h3>
        <p>
          When we reference a grid system, we generally think of elements being
          laid out in rows and columns. In Bones, a <code>spine</code> would be
          the row, and a <code>rib</code> would be a column within that row. A
          spine will fill it's parent container in width. Bones is based on
          eighths; that is, a full width rib is 100%, on down to the smallest
          rib being one-eighth the size of it's parent spine. Below is a
          reference of the rib sizes with class names.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>rib one</code> : 12.5%</li>
          <li><code>rib two</code> : 25%</li>
          <li><code>rib three</code> : 37.5%</li>
          <li><code>rib four</code> : 50%</li>
          <li><code>rib five</code> : 62.5%</li>
          <li><code>rib six</code> : 75%</li>
          <li><code>rib seven</code> : 87.5%</li>
          <li><code>rib full</code> : 100%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So for example, you could create a single row, three column layout
          area like this:
        </p>
<pre><code>&ltdiv class="spine"&gt
  &ltdiv class="rib two"&gtCONTENT&lt/div&gt
  &ltdiv class="rib four"&gtCONTENT&lt/div&gt
  &ltdiv class="rib two"&gtCONTENT&lt/div&gt
&lt/div&gt
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Your rib sizes don't necessarily have to add up to eight either. Many
          grid systems require your columns to add up to their core sizing
          scheme, such as a twelve column based system needing to be something
          like 4+6+2=12. These systems sometimes break or corral you into using
          their sizing standard. Bones is simple to change.	If you wanted, you
          could easily modify it to be based on 10, 12, or 16 column based
          sizing. To assist in making ribs easy to work with there are "mod"
          classes, which are covered below.

        <h3>Mods</h3>
        <p>
          Several mod classes exist in Bones to help more finely tweak layouts.
          Mods differ from utilities, in that mods specifically affect ribs.
          Below is an overview of these mod classes.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>l-margin</code> : Adds a 16px margin to the left of a rib</li>
          <li><code>r-margin</code> : Adds a 16px margin to the right of a rib</li>
          <li><code>t-margin</code> : Adds a 16px margin above a rib</li>
          <li><code>b-margin</code> : Adds a 16px margin below a rib</li>
          <li><code>push-one</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 12.5% margin</li>
          <li><code>push-two</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 25% margin</li>
          <li><code>push-three</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 37.5% margin</li>
          <li><code>push-four</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 50% margin</li>
          <li><code>push-five</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 62.5% margin</li>
          <li><code>push-six</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 75% margin</li>
          <li><code>push-seven</code> : Pushes a rib to the right with a 87.5% margin</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Utilities</h3>
        <p>
          Apart from mods, there are various utility classes that assist even more in fine
          tuning a layout. Over time new utility classes may be added to Bones, but for
          now you can take find an overview of the current ones below.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>body spaced</code> - Adds a 16px margin to the page</li>
          <li><code>body nine-sixty</code> - Sets max width of the body to 960px</li>
          <li><code>body twelve-eighty</code> - Sets the body to a maximum width of 1280px</li>
          <li><code>breaker</code> - A hard break, 100% width</li>
          <li><code>breaker sixteen</code> - Sets a breaker to have a height of 16px</li>
          <li><code>breaker thirty-two</code> - Sets a breaker's height to 32px</li>
          <li><code>breaker sixty-four</code> - Sets a breaker's height to 64px</li>
          <li><code>spine center</code> - Sets spine <code>justify-content</code> to center</li>
          <li><code>spine stretch</code> - Sets spine <code>align-items</code> to stretch</li>
          <li><code>filler</code> - 100% width with no margin or padding (helps fix some issues, but subject to removal)</li>
          <li><code>grower</code> - Sets a rib to grow to its spine's remaining width</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Customizing and Overrides</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, you will certainly get to the point where you need to add custom CSS or override
          something from Bones. This is easy to do- just make sure your CSS that overrides Bones is
          included after the Bones CSS.
